ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Banegerous (Matthew Bane), a front end web developer with over ten years of experience in web development & digital marketing. 

I've worked on a variety of projects for the affinity insurance market, which includes such notable clients as United Airlines MileagePlus as well as the National Education Association and many more.  

I'm passionate about creating great user experiences and have a strong understanding of design, usability and accessibility standards. 

Most of my past work has included the total front end experience from design, (Photoshop, Canva) to development, (HTML, CSS) and into client side scripting for form validation and dynamic parameter tracking (JavaScript).

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more complex JavaScript in order to expand my horizons into the full-stack arena.
